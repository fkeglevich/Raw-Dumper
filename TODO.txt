TODO list:

 - A better handling of unknown devices
   - (DONE!) The i3av4 header should always be saved in the DNG Exif MakerNote tag
   - Automatic discovery of raw image sizes
   - Automatic discovery of raw bayer pattern
   
 - Better handling of known devices
   - (IN PROGRESS) Change I3av4ToDngConverter so it takes into account the current camera configs (important!)
   - Do a better calibration profile of the Toshiba and OV sensors of the Z00A
      - Trying to use the red and blue gains
   - Use the Noise Profile DNG tag
   - (DONE!) Use a better default white balance (based on 5504K) for devices with known color matrices

 - (IMPORTANT - IN PROGRESS) Make the app work on ROMs using LL camera blobs (at least for the front camera)
 - (IMPORTANT - IN PROGRESS) Create the concept of Capture Context, that represents the many scenarios that can occur when taking
    raw pictures among different devices with different workarounds.
	
 - (IMPORTANT) Create the concept of "applied workarounds" for differents devices. This is specially useful for devices like
	the Zen2 that differ A LOT between camera blob's versions.
 - (IMPORTANT) Make the Build.MODEL to be dynamic and appear in the dng model tag
   
 - (IMPORTANT - IN PROGRESS) Make the app translatable to different languages
 - (IMPORTANT - IN PROGRESS) Make the app work on Android Nougat
 - (DONE!) Show the Build.MODEl when complaining for a unknown device!
   
 - (IN PROGRESS) Reduce overdraw
   
 - Save DNGs using tiles
 - Improve compatibility of generated DNG files for desktop apps like Darktable
 - (DONE!) Improve detecting and handling of Intel Camera features
   (Only use the Intel Camera features when 100% sure they can be used; because of the differences in 32 or 64 bits pointers)
 - (IMPORTANT - IN PROGRESS) Clean up the mess called MainActivity.java
 
 - (IMPORTANT - IN PROGRESS) Make the app work on more devices:
	- Razr I
	- Zenfone 5
	- Zenfone 2 with LL blobs
 
 - (IMPORTANT - IN PROGRESS) FIX THE GLUE CODE TO MAKE THE APP WORK IN THE NEXT RELEASE!
 
 - (DONE!) DeviceInfoLoader working!
 - Better handling of SU shell commands
 - (IMPORTANT - IN PROGRESS) Create a better separation layer between the UI and Camera threads
 - Create a better camera "reopening" for the MM Z00A front camera case 
   (and other cases where the camera crashes)
 - (DONE!) Better compatible Exif extraction
 
And maaaany other things...

Known bugs:
 - (MINOR) When displaying some dialog alerts, the app can get out from fullscreen state if the user switches to another app
 - (MINOR) When switching the app too fast, in some rare occasions, the camera is opened twice or the preview is frozen on Android Nougat

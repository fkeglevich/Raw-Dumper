TODO list:

 - A better handling of unknown devices
   - Automatic discovery of raw image sizes
   - Automatic discovery of raw bayer pattern

 - (IN PROGRESS) Do a better D65 calibration profile of the Toshiba and OV sensors of the Z00A

 - (IN PROGRESS) (IMPORTANT) Add the ~recovering photos~ user case, if the app crashes
   - Note:  temporarily save EVERY important information just before taking the pictures.
            So in a case of crash, the photos can be automatically recovered later

 - (IN PROGRESS) Basic refactoring
			
 - (FUTURE RELEASE) Simplify the code architecture
 - (FUTURE RELEASE) Use a simpler camera configuration scheme:
   - Simple parameter setting, restriction and correction
   - Better camera device encapsulating
			
 - (FUTURE RELEASE) Auto rotate the ISO/SS choosers
 - (FUTURE RELEASE) Handle different types of makernotes

 - (IN PROGRESS) Show aperture below the current shutter speed value (handle display rotation)
 
 - Add simple normal/low light button switch

 - Fallback to Gray World AWB algorithm when there's no other AWB algo available

 - (IN PROGRESS) Optimize logcat reading, right now the GC is crying
   - (DONE!) Migrate to libsu
   - (DONE!) Low-level high performance without memory allocations IO
   - (IN PROGRESS) Perform more optimizations (related to high frame updates and avoiding memory alloc)

 - Zoom feature for Zenfone Zoom

 - (IN PROGRESS) Take picture discarding the result (skip picture)
	
 - Restructure the camera access diagram

 - Optimize the DNG creation process
   - (IN PROGRESS) Don't calculate checksums

 - Create DNG with thumbnails

 - Migrate project to AndroidX

 - (IMPORTANT) Test the newer version of these devices:
	- Razr I
	- Zenfone 5

- (IN PROGRESS) Flash focus
	- remove these hardcoded values
	- remove the appearing of notification toasts
	- disable the feature when the device has laser
	- make the focus feature virtual
	- (IN PROGRESS) add small pad between the focus buttons

Next features:
 - Night Mode with raw pictures
 - Gain-based white balance
 - Slow Sync Flash

Known bugs:
 - (MINOR) When displaying dialog alerts, the app can get out from fullscreen state if the user switches to another app
 - (MINOR) Zen2 front camera breaks exposure at ISO 800 and 1/60 Shutter Speed
 - (MINOR) YUV pictures aren't affected by rotation.
    I am not really sure if I'm going to properly implement YUV capture because the it takes at least 8 seconds
    to save a 13 mpix lossless WEBP picture when the logcat service is disabled.
    Lossy webp is also too slow and the memory requirements are also too high.
    PNG capture is even slower.
    I probably won't enable YUV capture (right now) due to performance problems.
 
Done:

 - Better compatible Exif extraction
 - DeviceInfoLoader working!
 - Move the alignWidth from the sensor to the device json!
 - Improve detecting and handling of Intel Camera features
   (Only use the Intel Camera features when 100% sure they can be used; because of the differences in 32 or 64 bits pointers)

    raw pictures among different devices with different workarounds.

 - Visual feedback for touch focus/exposure region
 - Improve compatibility of generated DNG files for desktop apps like Darktable (only recognize uncompressed files with stripes)

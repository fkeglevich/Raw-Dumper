TODO list:

 - A better handling of unknown devices
   - (DONE!) The i3av4 header should always be saved in the DNG Exif MakerNote tag
   - Automatic discovery of raw image sizes
   - Automatic discovery of raw bayer pattern
   
 - Better handling of known devices
   - Change I3av4ToDngConverter so it takes into account the current camera configs (important!)
   - Do a better calibration profile of the Toshiba and OV sensors of the Z00A
      - Trying to use the red and blue gains
   - Use the Noise Profile DNG tag
   - (DONE!) Use a better default white balance (based on 5504K) for devices with known color matrices

 - (IMPORTANT) Make the app work on ROMs using LL camera blobs (at least for the front camera)
 - (IMPORTANT) Create the concept of Capture Context, that represents the many scenarios that can occur when taking
    raw pictures among different devices with different workarounds.
   
 - Save DNGs using tiles
 - Improve compatibility of generated DNG files for desktop apps like Darktable
 - Improve detecting and handling of Intel Camera features
   (Only use the Intel Camera features when 100% sure they can be used; because of the differences in 32 or 64 bits pointers)
 - Clean up the mess called MainActivity.java
 - Make the app finally work on the Razr I (needs DeviceInfoLoader working first)
 - Make the app start getting to work on the Zenfone 5 (needs DeviceInfoLoader working first)
 - Better handling of SU shell commands
 - Create a better separation layer between the UI and Camera threads
 - Create a better camera "reopening" for the MM Z00A front camera case 
   (and other cases where the camera crashes)
 - (DONE!) Better compatible Exif extraction
 
And maaaany other things...

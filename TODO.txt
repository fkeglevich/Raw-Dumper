TODO list:

 - A better handling of unknown devices
   - Automatic discovery of raw image sizes
   - Automatic discovery of raw bayer pattern

 - (IN PROGRESS) Do a better D65 calibration profile of the Toshiba and OV sensors of the Z00A

 - (IN PROGRESS) (IMPORTANT) Add the ~recovering photos~ user case, if the app crashes
   - Note:  temporarily save EVERY important information just before taking the pictures.
            So in a case of crash, the photos can be automatically recovered later

 - (FUTURE RELEASE) Add simple tonemapping
 - (FUTURE RELEASE) Basic refactoring
			
 - (FUTURE RELEASE) Simplify the code architecture
 - (FUTURE RELEASE) Use a simpler camera configuration scheme:
   - Simple parameter setting, restriction and correction
   - Better camera device encapsulating
			
 - (FUTURE RELEASE) Auto rotate the ISO/SS choosers
 - (FUTURE RELEASE) Handle different types of makernotes

 - Show aperture below the current shutter speed value (handle display rotation)
 
 - Add simple normal/low light button switch 

 - (IN PROGRESS) Collect adjusted white balance for many CCTs and create a polynomial function between them
   - Create function tint-temperature function for Zen2 rear camera
   - IDEA: instead, use a illuminant case-by-case basis for the tint too
   - update: this probably won't work as good as intended (maybe fallback to a fast Gray World AWB algorithm?)

 - (IN PROGRESS) Optimize logcat reading, right now the GC is crying
   - This is needed but hard to implement </3

 - Disable modes button when opening the camera

 - Zoom feature for Zenfone Zoom

 - (IN PROGRESS) Delay setting the parameter when using the slider by a couple milliseconds

 - (IN PROGRESS) Take picture discarding the result (skip picture)

 - Two new camera actions:
   - reset picture: taking a picture while discarding the result
   - reset camera:  closing and re-opening the camera while preserving the configurations
	
 - Restructure the camera access diagram
 
 - (IMPORTANT) Test the newer version of these devices:
	- Razr I
	- Zenfone 5

Next features:
 - Selection of picture size
 - Night Mode with raw pictures
 - Save pictures using the DNG SDK
   - Advantages: compression and DNG files that-always-work
 - Gain-based white balance

Known bugs:
 - (MINOR) When displaying dialog alerts, the app can get out from fullscreen state if the user switches to another app
 - (MINOR) Currently using the manual focus slider crashes Zenfone Zoom camera
 - (MINOR) Zen2 front camera breaks exposure at ISO 800 and 1/60 Shutter Speed
 - (MINOR) YUV pictures aren't affected by rotation.
    I am not really sure if I'm going to properly implement YUV capture because the it takes at least 8 seconds
    to save a 13 mpix lossless WEBP picture when the logcat service is disabled.
    Lossy webp is also too slow and the memory requirements are also too high.
    PNG capture is even slower.
    I probably won't enable YUV capture (right now) due to performance problems.
 
Done:
 - The i3av4 header should always be saved in the DNG Exif MakerNote tag

 - Better compatible Exif extraction
 - DeviceInfoLoader working!
 - Move the alignWidth from the sensor to the device json!
 - Improve detecting and handling of Intel Camera features
   (Only use the Intel Camera features when 100% sure they can be used; because of the differences in 32 or 64 bits pointers)

 - Make the Build.MODEL to be dynamic and appear in the dng model tag
 - Make the app translatable to different languages

 - Save DNGs using tiles
 - Use the Noise Profile DNG tag
 - Create a better separation layer between the UI and Camera threads
 - Restrict the exposure when an invalid ISO/Shutter/EV combination occur
 - Improve animations
 - Create round button disabled
 - (BUG FIXED) When switching the app too fast, in some rare occasions, the camera is opened twice or the preview is frozen on Android Nougat
 - FIXED TOUCH FOCUS POSITION YAAAY!
 - Added Iso and shutter speed metering
 - Add the extra logic for differentiating the zen2 camera blobs's version
 - Test Brightness metering (result: it's not obviously useful)

 - Create BufferFactory and use the maximum buffer size for all YUV/RAW picture captures
 - Create a better camera "reopening" for the MM Z00A front camera case 
   (and other cases where the camera crashes)
 - Added basic directory handling
 - Fix new enable/disable bug when taking pictures
 - Use checksums to validate the existence of patches
 - Visual feedback when a patch is required

    raw pictures among different devices with different workarounds.

 - Visual feedback for touch focus/exposure region
 - Improve compatibility of generated DNG files for desktop apps like Darktable (only recognize uncompressed files with stripes)

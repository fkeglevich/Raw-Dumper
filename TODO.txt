TODO list:

 - A better handling of unknown devices
   - Automatic discovery of raw image sizes
   - Automatic discovery of raw bayer pattern
   
 - Better handling of known devices
   - Do a better calibration profile of the Toshiba and OV sensors of the Z00A
      - Trying to use the red and blue gains

 - (IMPORTANT - IN PROGRESS) Create the concept of Capture Context, that represents the many scenarios that can occur when taking
    raw pictures among different devices with different workarounds.
	
 - (IMPORTANT) Create the concept of "applied workarounds" for differents devices. This is specially useful for devices like
	the Zen2 that differ A LOT between camera blob's versions.

 - Improve compatibility of generated DNG files for desktop apps like Darktable
   - Compatibility still needs to improve, because Darktable only recognize uncompressed files with stripes
 
 - (IN PROGRESS) Reduce overdraw
 
 - (IN PROGRESS) Autorotate the pictures taken using the phone orientation
   - Create OrientationActivity class or similar
 
 - (IMPORTANT - IN PROGRESS) Make the app work on more devices:
	- Razr I
	- Zenfone 5
	- Zenfone 2 with LL blobs
	
	- Possible problems:
	  - Avaliability of the Shutter Speed feature
	  - Mismatched number of cameras in the json
 
 - (IMPORTANT - IN PROGRESS) FIX THE GLUE CODE TO MAKE THE APP WORK IN THE NEXT RELEASE!
 
 - Better handling of SU shell commands
 - (IMPORTANT - IN PROGRESS) Create a better separation layer between the UI and Camera threads
 - Create a better camera "reopening" for the MM Z00A front camera case 
   (and other cases where the camera crashes)

Known bugs:
 - (MINOR) When displaying some dialog alerts, the app can get out from fullscreen state if the user switches to another app
 - (MINOR) When switching the app too fast, in some rare occasions, the camera is opened twice or the preview is frozen on Android Nougat
    - Some changes were made to address this bug, should test again to see if it still happens
 - The ActivityReferenceModule is going to break if the activity is recreated 
   (this probably won't happen on most executions of Raw Dumper, however, is considered extremely bad practice)
   (making a standardized way to get a updated weak reference from the activity is probably a better idea)
 
Done:

 - The i3av4 header should always be saved in the DNG Exif MakerNote tag
 - Use a better default white balance (based on 5504K) for devices with known color matrices
 - Better compatible Exif extraction
 - DeviceInfoLoader working!
 - Move the alignWidth from the sensor to the device json!
 - Improve detecting and handling of Intel Camera features
   (Only use the Intel Camera features when 100% sure they can be used; because of the differences in 32 or 64 bits pointers)
 - Show the Build.MODEl when complaining for a unknown device!
 - Make the app work on Android Nougat
 - Make the Build.MODEL to be dynamic and appear in the dng model tag
 - Make the app translatable to different languages
 - Add the brazillian portuguese language
 - Save DNGs using tiles
 - Use the Noise Profile DNG tag

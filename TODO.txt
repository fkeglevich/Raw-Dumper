TODO list:

 - A better handling of unknown devices
   - Automatic discovery of raw image sizes
   - Automatic discovery of raw bayer pattern
   - Note: this would require a whole new realtime-logcat-analysis module
     update: now we have that kind of module
   
 - Better handling of known devices
   - Do a better calibration profile of the Toshiba and OV sensors of the Z00A

 - Enable exposure touch-metering for the front camera (it's currently working on the rear camera, however is tied to the focus feature)

 - (IN PROGRESS) (IMPORTANT) Add the ~recovering photos~ user case, if the app crashes
   - Note:  temporarily save EVERY important information just before taking the pictures.
            So in a case of crash, the photos can be automatically recovered later

 - (IN PROGRESS) Create code for mean-gain-map stacking

 - (IN PROGRESS) Auto rotate UI elements
   - Needs to keep track of the old 90 degree value for a smoother transition
   - Needs to ignore the rotation when the rotation is too close to 45, 135, 225 and 315 degrees
   - Needs to increase the vertical area of the main control buttons

 - (IN PROGRESS) Handle different types of makernotes

 - (IN PROGRESS) Collect adjusted white balance for many CCTs and create a polynomial function between them
   - Create function tint-temperature function for Zen2 rear camera
   - IDEA: instead, use a illuminant case-by-case basis for the tint too
   - update: this probably won't work as good as intended (maybe fallback to a fast Gray World AWB algorithm?)

 - (IN PROGRESS) Optimize logcat reading, right now the GC is crying

 - (IN PROGRESS) Create YUV picture pipelines

 - (IN PROGRESS) Selection of white balance preset and manual white balance
   - Better translating of wb presets to AWB raw gains

 - (IN PROGRESS) Reduce overdraw
 
 - (ALMOST DONE) Autorotate the pictures taken using the phone orientation
   - (DONE!) Orient RAW pictures
   - (IN PROGRESS) Orient JPG/YUV pictures
 
 - (IMPORTANT) Test the newer version of these devices:
	- Razr I
	- Zenfone 5

Next features:
 - Selection of picture size
 - Gain-based white balance
 - Night Mode with raw pictures
 - Save pictures using the DNG SDK
   - Advantages: compression and DNG files that-always-work
 - Almost-perfect lens shading correction
   - (NOT ANYMORE!) requires DNG SDK for working with low-level gain maps dng opcodes
   - Idea: while DNG SDK support is not ready, simply apply the gain directly to the raw data
     update: we are going to create the low level opcodes by ourselves
 - Almost-perfect white balance
   - Needs some basic testing before. See WB-algorithm-idea.txt

Known bugs:
 - (MINOR) When displaying dialog alerts, the app can get out from fullscreen state if the user switches to another app
    - Some changes were made to address this bug, should test again to see if it still happens
 - (MINOR) The selector interface for ISO/shutter speed/EV is quite buggy sometimes
 
Done:

 - The i3av4 header should always be saved in the DNG Exif MakerNote tag
 - Use a better default white balance (based on 5504K) for devices with known color matrices
 - Better compatible Exif extraction
 - DeviceInfoLoader working!
 - Move the alignWidth from the sensor to the device json!
 - Improve detecting and handling of Intel Camera features
   (Only use the Intel Camera features when 100% sure they can be used; because of the differences in 32 or 64 bits pointers)
 - Show the Build.MODEl when complaining for a unknown device!
 - Make the app work on Android Nougat
 - Make the Build.MODEL to be dynamic and appear in the dng model tag
 - Make the app translatable to different languages
 - Add the brazilian portuguese language
 - Save DNGs using tiles
 - Use the Noise Profile DNG tag
 - Create a better separation layer between the UI and Camera threads
 - Restrict the exposure when an invalid ISO/Shutter/EV combination occur
 - Improve animations
 - Create round button disabled
 - (BUG FIXED) When switching the app too fast, in some rare occasions, the camera is opened twice or the preview is frozen on Android Nougat
 - FIXED TOUCH FOCUS POSITION YAAAY!
 - Added Iso and shutter speed metering
 - Add the extra logic for differentiating the zen2 camera blobs's version
 - Test Brightness metering (result: it's not obviously useful)
 - Don't use displayValue for getting parameter values (especially for FocusMode!)
 - Create BufferFactory and use the maximum buffer size for all YUV/RAW picture captures
 - Create a better camera "reopening" for the MM Z00A front camera case 
   (and other cases where the camera crashes)
 - Added basic directory handling
 - Fix new enable/disable bug when taking pictures
 - Use checksums to validate the existence of patches
 - Visual feedback when a patch is required
 - Create a proper isAvailable() (that works with non-patched LL Zen2) when choosing the raw picture format
 - Better handling of cameras without raw
 - (Not done because it's useless) Resume preview on postview callback
 - Test camera restart function
 - (DONE!) Disable Circular Reveal animations in Android 4.4.4
 - (DONE!) Create the concept of Capture Context, that represents the many scenarios that can occur when taking
    raw pictures among different devices with different workarounds.
 - Play animation when taking pictures (it also can be the old school circular progress bar)
 - Visual feedback for touch focus/exposure region
 - Improve compatibility of generated DNG files for desktop apps like Darktable (only recognize uncompressed files with stripes)
 - JPEG Pipeline done
 - Raw pipelines done, including a proper retrying case (long-exposure-front-camera-MM-blobs, need to literally wait for the light entering the sensor)
 - Faster retrying delay for ZenZoom front camera
 - Implement GPU-accelerated focus peaking
 - (FIXED) Sometimes there is a small glitch in the lower portion of the screen when the app is starting
 - (FIXED) Opcodes sometimes aren't written to the file
 - (Waaaaaaaay) better handling of SU shell commands
 - (FIXED) A non-camera-related exception during the camera opening process can crash the entire application
   (instead of simply displaying a nice error message)
 - (FIXED) The raw pictures now have the right orientation
 - New feature: pictures taken with the front camera are now properly mirrored
 - New feature: iso and shutter speed metering for the Zen2/Zoom front camera!
   ps: this *could* be enabled for others devices (razr I) as well
 - New feature: almost-perfect-auto-white-balance for the zen2/zen zoom cameras
   ps: this *could* be enabled for others devices (zen5, razr I) as well
 - Fixed not-so-rare race condition bug related to the shell creation process
 - Fixed shadows of the buttons and removed some unused layouts
 - FIXED TOUCH FOCUS (YAAY!)

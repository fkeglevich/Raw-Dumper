TODO list:

 - A better handling of unknown devices
   - Automatic discovery of raw image sizes
   - Automatic discovery of raw bayer pattern
   
 - Better handling of known devices
   - Do a better calibration profile of the Toshiba and OV sensors of the Z00A
      - Trying to use the red and blue gains (they're absent on Zen2 with LL blobs)

 - Test if 1/2 shutter speed on the front camera works on the Zen2 with LL blobs
 - Test if 1s long expo works on the Zen2 with LL blobs

 - Enable exposure touch-metering for the front camera (it's currently working on the rear camera, however is tied to the focus feature)

 - Visual feedback for touch focus/exposure region

 - Add the ~recovering photos~ if the app crash use case

 - (IN PROGRESS) Collect adjusted white balance for many CCTs and create a polynomial function between them
   - Create function tint-temperature function for Zen2 rear camera

 - Execute a small su test on unknown devices for avoiding loss of data (specially for Zen5 and Razr I)

 - Create the picture pipelines
   - (DONE!) Jpeg
   - (DONE!) Raw ((DONE!)NOTE: don't just delete files inside that hidden folder! delete the ones ending with i3av4!)
   - YUV

 - Improve compatibility of generated DNG files for desktop apps like Darktable (only recognize uncompressed files with stripes)
 
 - (IN PROGRESS) Reduce overdraw
 
 - (ALMOST DONE) Autorotate the pictures taken using the phone orientation
   - (DONE!) Create OrientationActivity class or similar
   - (ALMOST DONE) Needs to change the rotation parameter when shooting jpeg pictures
 
 - (IMPORTANT - IN PROGRESS) Make the app work on more devices:
	- Razr I
	- Zenfone 5
	- (DONE!) Zenfone 2 with LL blobs
	
	- Possible problems:
	  - (ALMOST SOLVED) Avaliability of the Shutter Speed feature
	  - (SOLVED) Mismatched number of cameras in the json
 
 - Better handling of SU shell commands

Next features:
 - PictureSizeFeature
 - Take actual pictures in the 2.0 version
 - Selection of focus mode and manual focus
 - Selection of white balance preset and manual white balance
 - Visual feedback when getting focus
 - Selection of picture size
 - Gain-basead white balance
 - Night Mode with raw pictures
 - Implement focus peaking

Known bugs:
 - (MINOR) When displaying dialog alerts, the app can get out from fullscreen state if the user switches to another app
    - Some changes were made to address this bug, should test again to see if it still happens
 - (MINOR) The space between the buttons is too small when the shutter is set to 1/10000
 
Done:

 - The i3av4 header should always be saved in the DNG Exif MakerNote tag
 - Use a better default white balance (based on 5504K) for devices with known color matrices
 - Better compatible Exif extraction
 - DeviceInfoLoader working!
 - Move the alignWidth from the sensor to the device json!
 - Improve detecting and handling of Intel Camera features
   (Only use the Intel Camera features when 100% sure they can be used; because of the differences in 32 or 64 bits pointers)
 - Show the Build.MODEl when complaining for a unknown device!
 - Make the app work on Android Nougat
 - Make the Build.MODEL to be dynamic and appear in the dng model tag
 - Make the app translatable to different languages
 - Add the brazillian portuguese language
 - Save DNGs using tiles
 - Use the Noise Profile DNG tag
 - Create a better separation layer between the UI and Camera threads
 - Restrict the exposure when an invalid ISO/Shutter/EV combination occour
 - Improve animations
 - Create round button disabled
 - (BUG FIXED) When switching the app too fast, in some rare occasions, the camera is opened twice or the preview is frozen on Android Nougat
 - FIXED TOUCH FOCUS POSITION YAAAY!
 - Added Iso and shutter speed metering
 - Add the extra logic for differenciating the zen2 camera blobs's version
 - Test Brightness metering (result: it's not obsviously useful)
 - Don't use displayValue for getting parameter values (especially for FocusMode!)
 - Create BufferFactory and use the maximum buffer size for all YUV/RAW picture captures
 - Create a better camera "reopening" for the MM Z00A front camera case 
   (and other cases where the camera crashes)
 - Added basic directory handling
 - Fix new enable/disable bug when taking pictures
 - Use checksums to validate the existence of patches
 - Visual feedback when a patch is required
 - Create a proper isAvailable() (that works with non-patched LL Zen2) when choosing the raw picture format
 - Better handling of cameras without raw
 - (Not done because it's useless) Resume preview on postview callback
 - Test camera restart function
 - (DONE!) Disable Circular Reveal animations in Android 4.4.4
 - (DONE!) Create the concept of Capture Context, that represents the many scenarios that can occur when taking
    raw pictures among different devices with different workarounds.
 - Play animation when taking pictures (it also can be the old school circular progress bar)
